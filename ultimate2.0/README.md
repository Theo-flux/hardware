# ULTIMATE 2.0
A flagship robot kit of makeblock platform. It contains various mechanical parts and electronic modules. This allows us to build more complicated robots and develop our creativity. With the ultimate2.0 we can build a variety of unique robots.
These robots are:

- Robotic Arm Tank
- Robotic Bartender: Robotic Bartender is made up of a mobile chassis also, a variable angle support structure and a self-adaptive bracket. Just as the name suggests, it performs the basic function of a bartender; it pours wine into a glass and delivers the glass to you. It also performs some other basic functions.
- Camera Dolly: Camera Dolly is also made of a mobile chassis and a 360-degree swivel base. This robot basically performs the work of a videographer for you. Hand it a mobile phone and a camera, this robot will begin to film at a low angle for you. Another interesting thing about this robot is that you can preset a path for it to follow in order to capture beautiful moments for you.
- Catapult Ram.
- Robotic Ant.
- Self-Balancing Robot.
- Rolling Tank.
- Detecting Robot.
- 3D Capture A & B.

With the ultimate2.0, you'll be gathering knowledge in mechanical, electrical and programming with ease.

# MegaPi; The Controller
The MegaPi board is a main control board specially designed for makers and also an ideal option for being applied to educational field and all kinds of matches. It is based on Arduino MEGA 2560n and supports programming with the arduino IDE perfectly. MegaPi can be divided into 6 function area, allowing you to connect with various plug-in modules to drive motors and sensors and to realize wireless communication. MegaPi has a strong motor-driving ability which is capable of driving 10 servos or 8DC motors simultaneously. It is the ideal option for various robotic projects, such as smart robot car and 3D printer.

## Technical Specifications Of MegaPi
