# ELEGOO SMART ROBOT CAR
The Eleego Smart Robot Car or ESRC is an arduino based smart robot car that requires no soldering or special tools.
This robot car can be built using the Elegoo Smart Robot Car Kit.
The Kit includes the following components:
1.	2 LiPo batteries and a charger.
2.	Arduino Uno R3 card.
3.	2pins, 3pins, 4pins, 5pins & 6pins cables. 
4.	Line Tracking Module.
5.	I/O Expansion Board.
6.	L298N 
7.	Cell Box
8.	DC Motors
9.	Tires
10.	USB Cable
11.	Fixing Plate
12.	Ultrasonic Sensor
13.	Bluetooth Module
14.	Insulation Tapes
15.	Acrylic Chassis
16.	IR Remote
### DESCRIPTION OF THE ESRC
The ESRC is a 4-wheel design with two levels (i.e it has two layers of acrylic chasis mounted on each other).
On the top layer of the robot, we have Ultrasonic sensor mounted on the servo motors. The combination is then placed on the acrylic chassis. Other components placed on the top acrylic chassis include the cell box which contains the 2 LiPo (Lithium Polymer) batteries. The I/O Expansion borad is connected directly above the arduino Uno R3 card.
The lower level of the robot has the L298N placed on it with the four DC motors placed around the four corners to accommodate the four tyres. Beneath the  acrylic chassis, we have the Line Tracking Module. The ESRC is controlled by either the Bluetooth module or the IR Remote control.
The ESRC allows you to build;
1.	A Bluetooth controlled car.
2.	IR controlled car.
3.	Obstacle Avoidance car.

### BUILDING THE ELEGOO SMART ROBOT CAR
The ESRC is designed in such a way that it can be assembled in just a couple of easy steps. It takes about 45 â€“ 60 minutes to assembly for a first timer but subsequent attempts take lesser time to complete. Assembling the ESRC can be completed in about distinct 12 steps. As we work work you through the steps, some precautions will be given to ensure accurate assembly of the robot.
#### STEPS IN ASSEMBLING THE ESRC
###### LEVEL 1: THE GROUND ACRYLIC CHASSIS
1. Install and mount the Line Tracking module beneath the lower acrylic chassis. Caution: Take note of the direction of the cable port and orientation to the big hole.
2. Mount the L298N on the chassis.
3. Assemble and then mount the DC motors on the sides of the acrylic chassis. Caution: The aluminum blocks and motor power cables should be on the side of the. 
4. Connect the tyres to the four DC motors.

###### LEVEL 2: THE TOP ACRYLIC CHASSIS
5. Mount the elegoo Uno R3 card on the centre of acrylic chassis.
6. Assemble the SG90 servo motor and mount on the chassis.Caution: Pay attention to the inserting direction of the servo cable terminal. Orange is      the signal wire and should be connected to pin 3 on the Uno card.
7. Assemble the Ultrasonic Sensor Module and place it on the SG90 servo motor.
8. Mount the Cell Box on the Chassis
9. Connect the two acrylic chassis together using the rods provided.
