# CODEY ROCKY
Codey Rocky combines hardware with software, allowing children to learn about programming while they play and create. 
Using mBlock, a software which supports both blocked-based and Python programming, 
Codey Rocky takes children by their hands and leads them into the world of avant-garde technology with its inbuilt AI and IoT functionalities, 
giving them a competitive edge in the AI era.

## Structure of Codey Rocky
The innovative structure of this educational robot is made in such a way that it is made up of two distinct parts that can be
Combined to form a whole robot.
### Brainy Codey
Integrated with over 10 programmable electronic modules, Codey Rocky has more features than it meets the eye.

### Agile Rocky
Not only will Codey Rocky swirl and follow lines but also go around obstacles, making creation so much more fun.

## Software Learning + Hardware Creation â€” the fun way to learn about programming
Harnessing the power of mBlock software, Codey Rocky allows children to create dot matrix animations, 
design games and realize AI and IoT applications. 
By programming every move made by the robot, not only will children understand each command intuitively, 
but they will also find it a rewarding experience through hardware creation.

Codey Rocky allows you to control it using either the scratch programming block or python programming block.

The choice of language to use is totally dependent on the age of the child. 

### scratch:
a programming language developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for children, is currently the most widely used visual programming language in the world.
